# The Project: 'you need our eyes to see us'

Our project responded to the concept ‘How would you reconcile historical objects with contemporary stories in a multisensory way?’ The curators we were paired with provided us with photos of some of the objects in their Oceania collection. We responded to these objects - we call them rather treasures in our own languages - as poets, by writing a suite of poems called 'you need our eyes to see us'.

The poems are like love letters or conversations, wonderings and memories. We understood that we needed not only to provide the museum with a bunch of poems we wrote, but also allow them access to the finer points of our inner decision making as indigenous artists. Why would we write poems instead of doing any one of a million other possibilities? What does poetry from indigenous writers bring into this context that traditional museum methods don’t? Why did we make each of the micro decisions we made that led to the creation of ‘you need our eyes to see us’? The logic model or prototype that we decided upon with Abhay’s guidance is that of ‘poetry as metadata.’ From the data that currently exists about these treasures, we might learn where they came from, from whom and by whom they were acquired, when they were made, which materials they were made from. Often we only know one of these things. Our poetry provides other meaningful data: the intangible; genealogical Pohnpeian / Māori perspectives; indigenous language; place names; origin stories (real or questioned); in other words, our poems flesh out the emotional, genealogical and cultural context of these treasures and the violence of their separation from their communities.

To us as indigenous people, these precious objects are not, and never have been, stationary, dead or passive. They always and already resonate and vibrate with the mauri, the life force, the energy of those who made them and those who continue to love and miss them. In our poems we imagine them learning; we speak and write them into remembering and conversing with each other and with the museum visitors, with us and even with the glass cases which contain them.

Kalahngan en kupwuramwail! Tena tatou katoa, thank you all for your attention!

## The Prototype: 'ynoetsu'
ynoetsu is an interactive collection of poems presented as mixed media pieces in a video format.

The audience is taken on a journey browsing phrases from the poems. These phrases and words are used as metadata. Output is in the form of generative semi-random mixed media. Each piece has multiple versions of media mixed and sliced, such as: text, author's voice, ambient sound, video of the author and the environment where the objects from the collection are coming from. Presented works are focused on emotional impact. Pseudo-randomness bypasses hierarchy and provides a unique experience to the audience.
